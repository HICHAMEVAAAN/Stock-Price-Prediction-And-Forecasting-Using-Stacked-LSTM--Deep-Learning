## üìÑ Understanding the Data

The application uses historical stock price data from Apple (AAPL). It processes this data to forecast future prices using advanced deep learning techniques, specifically Stacked LSTM.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

To run this application:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python Version:** 3.6 or higher.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 100 MB free space for installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application employs Stacked LSTM to analyze historical stock data. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection:** Historical data is gathered from reliable financial sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and organize the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training:** The application trains the LSTM model using historical data to predict future prices based on patterns.
4. **Prediction:** Users can input different parameters and receive forecasts.

## üìö Included Libraries

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning functionalities.
- **Flask & Streamlit:** For building web applications.

## ‚ùì FAQs
